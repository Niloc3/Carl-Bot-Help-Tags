# Carl-Bot Help Tags


> An explanation for all of the tags in the carl-bot help server




### What Are Tags

Tags are custom commands. They are easy to use and can be very powerful. It is for instance entirely possible to create an 8ball command, a hug command and many other things using just tags. To do more than just output plaintext, you must configure the command's behavior using what is called Tagscript. Tagscript is a small language the bot interprets, made up of dynamic "blocks". To build a tag you will need to combine various blocks to tell the tag what you want it to do. Some parts of Tagscript can be used elsewhere within Carl-bot, like in Triggers, Autofeeds, and Welcome/Leave/Ban Messages.

### How do I use tags

You can use a tag like you would use any other command, for example if I wanted to use the `howtobecool` tag I would just send a prefix and then "howtobecool". The prefixes for the carl-bot help server are `@carl-bot` `pl` `hey carl can you ` `PL` `Pl` `?` `.` `-` `,` `+` `!`. So if I wanted to use the `!` prefix i would send `!howtobecool` in the channel I want carl-bot to respond in.

### Why should I use tags

Using tags makes supporting users much easier. Tags make it so you do not have to remember as much info and can make responding to users much faster. Tags also often use embeds. This is important because they can organize info much better then a normal message.
